/*
Sorting: an operation that rearranges unordered items into ordered itmes according to a specified
criteria

A = [1,2,4,3]   Unsorted
A = [1,2,3,4]   Sorted

By default code should be sorted in ascending order

Types of sorting algorithms (* Have to Know Well)
*    -Bubble Sort           -Quick Sort
*    -Selection Sort        -Counting Sort
*    -Insertion Sort
     -Merge Sort
     -Heap Sort
                     Time and Space Complexity varies 
    Selection Sort = n^2
    Insertion Sort = n^2
    Merge Sort = n log(n)
    Quick Sort = n log(n)
    Counting Sort = n

Bubble Sort 
    - Bubble up the highest value (ascending order)
    - Ascending order: low values to right values (left to right)
    Case 1:
    [4] [1]
        Bubble up [4] to the place of 1 (by checking than moving up or going to the other pair)
    [1] [4]
