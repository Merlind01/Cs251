    Time Complexity

    Space Complexity
        
    Auxillary Space (additional code that is not needed)

Big O Notation
    - Commonly reffered to as "order of" is a way to express the upper bound of an alhorithm's
    time complexity, since it analyses the worst case situation of algorithm.
    5 = O(8)        5 is big O of 8
    5 <= O(8)       5 is big O of 8
    5 <= O(5)       5 is big O of 5

f(n) = C * g(n)  - C = constant value
f(n) = Og(n)

[11, 5, 9, 3.....6]
    using the worst case to find 6 the time complexity would be O(n) - Big O the length of the List

if f(n) = O g(n) <-wrong statement 
and g(n) = O h(n)
than f(n) = O h(n) <-correct statement

    If using nested for loop to create a [][][][][][][]  Suppose n is the length for both loops
Big O (n^2)                              [][][][][][][]  


for (i = 0; i <n; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j <p; j++) {

    }

}
        -   Big O (n * p)


    Worst Case O(n!) , O(c^n), O(n^c)
    Bad Case O(nlog(n))
    Fair Case O(n)
    Best Case O(C) - of a constant
