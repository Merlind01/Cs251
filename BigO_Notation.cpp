    Time Complexity

    Space Complexity
        
    Auxillary Space (additional code that is not needed)

Big O Notation
    - Commonly reffered to as "order of" is a way to express the upper bound of an alhorithm's
    time complexity, since it analyses the worst case situation of algorithm.
    5 = O(8)        5 is big O of 8
    5 <= O(8)       5 is big O of 8
    5 <= O(5)       5 is big O of 5

f(n) = C * g(n)  - C = constant value
f(n) = Og(n)

[11, 5, 9, 3.....6]
    using the worst case to find 6 the time complexity would be O(n) - Big O the length of the List
