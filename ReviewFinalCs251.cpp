/* 
Unique data structures / Important topics
 - Optional (if answer is 0 will return no pointer) / For very specific cases
 - Bloom Filter (bit array) (uses K-Hash functions)
 - Rope (similar to string / intert to front,middle, or back)
 - Skip Lists
 - Zippers (Cursors / Current Location of the Cursor)
 - Heaps (Min / Max)
 - Hash Tables (For sorting info that gets ordered at a large amount)        **** 
       Table saves location of data
       
       []  <- First peice of data might go here
       []
       []
       []  <- second might go here (Doesnt require going from top to bottom)
       []
       []
       
       Collision may occur when there is not a space in between data for example to store 10 values its recommended to make a hash table that can store 20:
              To clear a collision another hash table can be made

       [A]
       [ ]  <- A2 asked to be placed so will go here
       [B]
       [ ]    
       [C]

 - Fractals
